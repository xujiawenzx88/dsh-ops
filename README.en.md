# dsh-ops-zx88

OPS adds bounded file and document tools to DSH. Native mode returns compact, line-numbered text;
PTC code receives typed Outcome values from the same one-shot Rust worker. Host integration is
strict TypeScript, compiled to the existing JavaScript package paths.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This package is **Windows x64 only**. Its identity is `dsh-ops-zx88@0.1.0`, based on the upstream dsh-ops 0.4.0 candidate source. Upstream release gates and acceptance benchmarks are recorded in [release status](docs/release-0.4.0.md); this fork did not re-run them, so upstream performance claims are not independent results for this fork.
> Install the published package with `npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile desktop`.

- Native starts with `ops_read_many` and `ops_discover`; eligible Windows sessions also receive
  `ops_bash`. Advanced tools activate in the owning agent's next provider request.
- The PTC SDK catalogue has 19 APIs: 16 file/document tools, batch, result references and its loader.
  Only the configured resident or selected APIs are exposed. Native and PTC use separate outputs.
- Discover bounded CSV/TSV, DOCX main-body paragraphs and a restricted PDF text layer. Binary DOC,
  OCR, general PDF rendering, web search and HTML crawling are not implemented. Read the
  [document-format limits](docs/native-kernel.md) before choosing a reader.
- Seven independently toggled rows preserve saved profile IDs and settings. Per-tool official
  replacements are off by default. [Settings](docs/configuration-reference.md) include validated
  built-in forms and optional browser pages with an explicit offline carrier migration.
- Windows Bash is optional: install a verified managed copy with `dsh-ops-zx88 bash-runtime install`
  or choose Git Bash through `bashPath`. PowerShell stays host-managed; its upgrade command previews
  the standard installation and requires `--yes` to execute. Neither shell is an npm payload.

OPS publishes its own scoped tools and optional routing guidance; it does not rewrite the shared
tool registry. Permissions and cancellation are checked per call. Windows restricted Bash retains
its documented partial enforcement and runtime-compatibility limits.

Historical token-saving claims are not evidence that this candidate meets its release gates.
The name “ops” means general operations, not an operations/SRE product.

## Install, update and uninstall

### Official plugin marketplace

In the target DSH application's plugin marketplace, enter the npm package name **`dsh-ops-zx88`**, choose a custom registry and enter `https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/repository/npm/`, install, then enable it. Installing through npmmirror is currently not recommended — it has bugs.

Of course, if you are sure you can reach the official npm registry, pick the official registry; if you are not sure, follow the steps above.

### One-command npm installation

#### Installation

```console
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile desktop
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile web
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile tui
```

An explicit target profile is required. `tui` maps to the **dsh-TUI product's `dsh-tui` profile**, not the old `tui` directory. Initialize the target application first. This entry point delegates installation to the official DSH CLI rather than implementing a separate profile lock and rollback logic.

Desktop must use the CLI bundled with the desktop application; the default auto-detected path is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\DeepSeek Harness\resources\runtime\cli\bin\dsh.cmd`. For another installation location, add `--dsh-cli "<installation>\resources\runtime\cli\bin\dsh.cmd"`. Web/TUI require an available DSH CLI, which can also be specified explicitly.

You can also use the official commands directly:

```console
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-ops-zx88
dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add dsh-ops-zx88
"<desktop installation>\resources\runtime\cli\bin\dsh.cmd" plugin --profile desktop add dsh-ops-zx88
```

A regular DSH CLI cannot manage the reserved `desktop` profile; do not confuse it with the desktop app's own entry point.

#### Update

Re-run the same `npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile ...`, or use the official CLI `add dsh-ops-zx88@latest`. Reload when the app asks; restart the app when replacing code that is already loaded.

#### Uninstall and status

```console
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest status --profile desktop
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest uninstall --profile desktop
```

Replace `desktop` with `web` or `tui` as needed. You can also uninstall from the marketplace, or run the official `dsh plugin --profile ... remove dsh-ops-zx88`. Profile uninstall removes plugin dependency references. Remove separately downloaded Bash with `dsh-ops-zx88 bash-runtime remove --yes`; this does not delete the system shell, copies in other profiles, or the package manager's shared cache.

Old files explicitly provisioned by earlier versions under `<DSH_HOME>/dsh-ops/` (provisioned shells, and the FastCtx runtime earlier versions could provision) need separate cleanup: `npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest uninstall --yes`. The `~/.fastctx/` state left by the removed background component is not deleted by default; add `--purge-fastctx` when needed.

The former `dsh-ops/background` component (FastCtx background jobs) has been removed. A profile that still has its row keeps loading: the row publishes nothing and logs one warning, and can be deleted.

## Optional read-only OPS sidebar

Enable the `dsh-ops-zx88/tui` row in dsh-TUI and restart to add the OPS sidebar without stealing focus or executing tools. Without `tuiPanels`, only that optional row stays pending. See [Sidebar guide](docs/tui-panel.md). While focused, use `f` to filter, `n`/`p` for local pages and `a` to acknowledge all-session alerts; only bounded retained metadata is browsed, never fetched result pages.
