# Usage

The complete install, update and remove flow, plus every option of the command-line interface.

## 0.1.1 fork and component defaults (upstream 0.4.0 candidate)

This fork publishes the upstream 0.4.0 candidate source as `0.1.1` for Windows x64. Upstream acceptance uses the approved OPS 0.3.x BM-01 comparator and file/discovery BM-03 budget, with Bash still resident and the full total reported separately.
See [candidate status](release-0.4.0.md). The seven rows enable file/PTC/discovery, enable shell only
on Windows, and leave panel/TUI/replacements off in fresh profiles. Existing explicit switches and
name-qualified settings survive upgrade. Only read_many/discover are initially resident in Native,
plus available Windows Bash; documents load on demand. The PTC catalogue has 19 typed APIs, with its
own configured pool and SDK loader. [Configuration](configuration-reference.md) describes built-in
forms and the optional browser carrier. Use [manual acceptance](manual-validation.md) for upgrades.

## Prerequisites

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Windows x64 only in this fork; optional OPS Bash defaults on |
| Node.js | `^22.19 \|\| >=24` (the `engines` field in `package.json`) |
| Host | DSH `0.2.0-rc.2` |
| Target application | Initialized |

### macOS arm64

> Not supported by `dsh-ops-zx88@0.1.1`: this fork is Windows x64 only. The upstream instructions are retained for future builds.

macOS carries no bundled shell payload, and the native worker is not part of the
repository on any platform, so two extra steps apply.

Build and stage the worker once from the checkout (Rust >= 1.88):

```console
cargo build --release --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml
node bin/native-runtime.mjs stage --platform darwin-arm64
```

Then point the shell row at a bash the machine already has:

```yaml
- id: dsh-ops-zx88-shell
  name: dsh-ops-zx88/shell
  disabled: false
  config:
    bashPath: /opt/homebrew/bin/bash
```

The desktop application's bundled CLI lives inside its own installation, at
`.../Contents/Resources/runtime/cli/bin/dsh` on macOS, rather than at the
`%LOCALAPPDATA%` path used on Windows. The host exposes no pwsh row on macOS, so
PowerShell 7 is unavailable there. See [macOS arm64](macos-arm64.md) for the
capability matrix and the known limitations.

## Install

### Official plugin marketplace

In the target DSH application's plugin marketplace, enter the npm package name **`dsh-ops-zx88`**, install, then enable. Installation belongs to the currently running profile, which is `desktop` for the desktop app. Neither Bash nor PowerShell binaries are npm dependencies. Bash is acquired separately through the runtime manager; PowerShell stays under host control. Installation runs no shell downloader and does not change system PATH.

### Optional Bash runtime

Bash is no longer an npm dependency. On Windows, install the verified managed copy explicitly, or select an existing Git Bash:

```console
dsh-ops-zx88 bash-runtime status
dsh-ops-zx88 bash-runtime install
dsh-ops-zx88 bash-runtime git
dsh-ops-zx88 bash-runtime managed
dsh-ops-zx88 bash-runtime remove            # preview only
dsh-ops-zx88 bash-runtime remove --yes      # remove receipt-marked managed versions
```

`git` and `managed` print an absolute `bashPath` configuration for the host config editor; they do not edit a profile or PATH. Reload the shell component after applying the selection or installing/removing its runtime. Stop running Bash jobs before removal. Removal refuses links in the managed path and preserves unmarked versions, system Git and PowerShell. `install` reuses the pinned download and checksum checks from `provision-shells --bash`; `--dry-run` makes no download or change. Windows restricted modes still require the pinned MSYS IPC compatibility match. A different Git Bash remains a full-access choice; approval never repairs an incompatible restricted runtime. This fork does not ship or validate Linux/macOS targets.

### One-command npm installation

```console
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile desktop
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile web
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile tui
```

An explicit target profile is required. `tui` maps to the **dsh-TUI product's `dsh-tui` profile**, not the old `tui` directory. Initialize the target application first. This entry point delegates installation to the official DSH CLI rather than implementing separate profile locking and rollback logic.

Desktop must use the CLI bundled with the desktop application; the default auto-detected path is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\DeepSeek Harness\resources\runtime\cli\bin\dsh.cmd`. For another installation location, add `--dsh-cli "<installation>\resources\runtime\cli\bin\dsh.cmd"`. Web/TUI require an available DSH CLI, which can also be specified explicitly.

### Using the official commands directly

```console
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-ops-zx88
dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add dsh-ops-zx88
"<desktop installation>\resources\runtime\cli\bin\dsh.cmd" plugin --profile desktop add dsh-ops-zx88
```

The ordinary DSH CLI cannot manage the reserved `desktop` profile; do not confuse it with the desktop app's bundled entry point.

---

## Update

Repeat the same `npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest install --profile ...` command, or use the official CLI's `add dsh-ops-zx88@latest`. Reload as requested by the application; restart it when replacing already-loaded code.

---

## Remove and check status

```console
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest status --profile desktop
npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest uninstall --profile desktop
```

Replace `desktop` with `web` or `tui` as appropriate. You can also uninstall in the marketplace or run the official `dsh plugin --profile ... remove dsh-ops-zx88`. Binaries are managed as profile plugin dependencies; uninstalling removes dependency references without deleting system shells, copies in other profiles or shared package-manager caches.

Legacy explicitly provisioned `<DSH_HOME>/dsh-ops/` files (provisioned shells, and the FastCtx runtime earlier versions could provision) must be cleaned separately with `npx --yes dsh-ops-zx88@latest uninstall --yes`. The `~/.fastctx/` state left by the removed background component is kept by default; add `--purge-fastctx` explicitly to remove it as well.

---

## Host PowerShell on Windows

OPS no longer bundles PowerShell or changes the host's `pwshPath`. Windows PowerShell 5.1, existing custom executors and old OPS provisioned copies remain untouched. To install or upgrade the standard PowerShell 7 installation, first inspect the plan:

```console
dsh-ops-zx88 upgrade-host-pwsh
dsh-ops-zx88 upgrade-host-pwsh --yes --dry-run
dsh-ops-zx88 upgrade-host-pwsh --yes
```

Only `--yes` executes WinGet; `--dry-run` always previews. The action uses the exact stable `Microsoft.PowerShell` package from the `winget` source and retains WinGet's installer and agreement prompts. It may require Windows elevation. Missing WinGet produces guidance without attempting installation; see [Microsoft's Windows installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-powershell-on-windows).

Restart DSH after successful installation so the host probes its executor again. An explicit host `pwshPath` remains authoritative: review it in host settings if it points elsewhere. A `no-update` result means WinGet found no applicable update for this package, not that every custom PowerShell copy is current. Cancellation after the installer starts has unknown effects; check the standard installation before retrying. The older `provision-shells --pwsh` command remains an explicit compatibility download, but OPS does not activate its copy automatically.

## Command-line interface

```console
dsh-ops-zx88 install --profile <desktop|web|tui> [--dsh-cli <path>]
dsh-ops-zx88 uninstall --profile <desktop|web|tui> [--dsh-cli <path>]
dsh-ops-zx88 status --profile <desktop|web|tui>
                                Report target-profile installation (tui maps to dsh-tui)
dsh-ops-zx88 build-ptc              Build the independent native Rust worker (all platforms)
dsh-ops-zx88 uninstall [--yes] [--purge-fastctx]
dsh-ops-zx88 ladder [--json] [--config <file>]
                                prompt ladder actually renders; nothing is spawned
dsh-ops-zx88 upgrade-host-pwsh [--yes] [--dry-run]
dsh-ops-zx88 provision-shells [--bash] [--pwsh] [--force] [--dry-run] [--pin <file>]
                                their digests, and install them under <DSH_HOME>/dsh-ops/shells
```

With `--profile`, install/uninstall delegate to the official DSH profile manager.
Without `--profile`, uninstall only cleans legacy provisioned runtime/shell files.
`resolve`, `status` (without `--profile`), `build` and `provision` were removed with the FastCtx background component; each now exits with a message naming its replacement.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `HTTPS_PROXY` | Proxy handed to curl explicitly by provision-shells |
| `DSH_OPS_REQUIRE_RUNTIME` | Make `npm run verify` require an available runtime |
| `DSH_OPS_WORKER_BIN` | Select a worker build (otherwise `runtime/<platform>-<arch>/` then `native/target/release`) |
| `DSH_OPS_VCVARS64` | Supplies the MSVC environment when building Bash IPC proxies |

## Script files: `command` versus `script_path`

Use `ops_bash`'s `command` for short commands and pipelines. For scripts longer than about 1 KB, or containing heredocs, quotes, backslashes or non-ASCII text, write the script with the host file tools first, then execute it with `script_path`; do not put the entire heredoc in `command`. This substantially reduces multi-layer escaping in tool-call JSON and lowers the chance that a turn is discarded as `MALFORMED_RESPONSE`.

`script_path` accepts only the script path, so the script body is not repeated in the `ops_bash` arguments. `command` and `script_path` are mutually exclusive and exactly one is required. This interface cannot repair JSON that the model or host failed to parse; an unparseable tool call still requires a host/model retry.

`ops_bash` requires a non-empty `description` and keeps the host Bash fields and result kinds: `foreground`, `background`, or `promoted`. Its default timeout is 120 seconds and the cap is 600 seconds. When the host jobs service is available, `run_in_background: true` returns a job ID immediately; a foreground timeout promotes the same running job. Use the host `job_output` and `job_kill` tools to collect or stop it. Without host jobs, the background parameter is absent and a foreground timeout stops the command. Unknown arguments are rejected before execution.

`sandbox_permissions` plus `justification` can request a strictly wider mode through the host approval service. An allowed-once grant applies to that command only; rejection never executes it or changes the session mode. Authority is checked again after approval and sandbox preparation. Windows confinement reports the host provider’s actual enforcement (including `partial`); incompatible Bash runtimes fail closed.

`script_path` (instead of `command`), `graceMs`, and `includeDiagnostics` remain explicit OPS compatibility extensions. They do not change the host command contract or its timeout limits.

---

## Process reclamation

This version starts no long-lived server process or persistent IPC. After a call that starts a worker, the native file component may keep at most four idle one-shot workers; each exits after five minutes without work, handles exactly one request, rechecks authority per call, is discarded when its session is disposed or its sandbox mode changes, and stops with the file component. Set `prewarmWorker: false` to disable prewarming. Earlier versions with the background component started `fastctx serve` clients and could leave a shared FastCtx `runtime-host`; that process exits on its own after about ten minutes without clients. This release does not sweep processes left by older versions; do not kill them by process-name sweeps.

---

## Update configuration modification area

`lib/config-updates.js` centralizes one-time config migrations. On first startup with 0.2.5, each owning component row runs a self-check:

- With no `configUpdateVersion` (or `0`), change legacy `allowSystemShellFallback: true` to `false` before resolving executors or publishing tools.
- Submit the raw owning row through the official loader lifecycle with `configUpdateVersion: 1`. Preserve other fields; never change foreign plugins, PATH or global config. Disabled components migrate when first started.
- After completion, restarts/hot reload do not overwrite a later manual `true`. Do not remove the marker unless you intend to repeat the self-check.
- Without an owning loader row, apply the safe value for this activation and warn. Migration/loader logs report write failures; a marker not persisted to disk cannot guarantee once-only behavior across restarts.

## Native file results

Native file tools present readable text: `=== FILE: path (Lines a-b of n) ===`
followed by `N | text`; fully returned multi-file ranges use compact `N|text` and may share one JSON-quoted parent path. Paths, observed revisions and paging notices remain visible. See [compact ranges](native-ranges.md).
PTC execution values remain structured objects; inspect `status` and completeness
before using them. Grep context labels use the physical source line, while glob
path mode lists one path per line. Stat retains size, revision and metadata facts;
diff shows removed/added lines. Mutation tools return short receipts without
repeating file contents.

Only physical LF ends a line (CRLF is one boundary). Empty files have zero lines;
a final LF adds no empty line. Bare CR and Unicode separators do not add lines; control separators are escaped
in the display so they cannot break a numbered line.
Writing text preserves its bytes and line endings. Reads auto-detect UTF-8, GB18030
and BOM-marked UTF-16 (LE/BE); `ops_inspect_local_file` can force one codec with
`encoding`. Edits and overwrites keep the detected codec (a lone UTF-16 BOM is
re-attached); new files are UTF-8. Bytes no supported codec can decode, or characters
it cannot encode, return `ERR_INVALID_ENCODING`, with guidance to use a document/binary
reader or `view: "hex"`; no lossy text replacement is performed.

Native content blocks are capped at 64 KiB after JSON escaping. A clipped display
says `Display incomplete` / `TruncatedBy: output-budget`; request a smaller original
read range instead of advancing past undisplayed text. A truncated line cannot be
recovered by moving to the next line: use hex byte rows. A clipped mutation receipt
is not permission to repeat a write: inspect current state first. Error notices
show effect state and retry guidance before potentially long diagnostic messages.
